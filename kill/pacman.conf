# # REPOSITORIES
# #   - can be defined here or included from another file
# #   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
# #   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
# #   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
# #     have identical names, regardless of version number
# #   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
# #   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
# #
# # Repository entries are of the format:
# #       [repo-name]
# #       Server = ServerName
# #       Include = IncludePath
# #
# # The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# # uncommented to enable the repo.
# #

# # The testing repositories are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment the
# # repo name header and Include lines. You can add preferred servers immediately
# # after the header, and they will be used before the default mirrors.
